# Unit Testing with jest with TypeScript

A small implementation of a queue and test cases to run automated unit tests using the jest testing library in TypeScript.

## To run:

-   Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/k4u5h4L/jest-testing-ts && cd jest-testing-ts/
```

-   Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

### Run tests:

-   Run tests:

```
yarn test
```

You'll get a run down of the test cases implemented in `src/test/`

### Run in interactive mode:

-   Run the `play.ts` file:

```bash
yarn dev

# OR

yarn run watch
# in another terminal, run
yarn start
```

Now you can interact with the queue in the console
